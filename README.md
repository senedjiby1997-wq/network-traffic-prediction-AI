# 🚀 Network Traffic Prediction using Deep Learning (LSTM)

## 🎯 Objective
This project aims to predict future network traffic using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model.
It helps anticipate congestion, optimize resources, and improve network Quality of Service (QoS).

## 🧩 Project Overview
The model learns from past traffic data (bandwidth, latency, packet rate, etc.) and predicts future load on the network.

### Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. LSTM model training
3. Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
4. Visualization and prediction

## 🧰 Technologies
- Python 3
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Plotly
- (Optional) Streamlit, AWS EC2

## 📊 Example Output
LSTM achieved R² = 0.95 with realistic time-series data.
